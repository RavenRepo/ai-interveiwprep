-   **Instant Feedback**: Provide immediate, actionable feedback on answers, covering both technical accuracy and soft skills.
-   **Personalization**: Tailor questions to the user's specific resume and target job role.
-   **Accessibility**: Make high-quality interview coaching accessible 24/7 without human interviewers.
